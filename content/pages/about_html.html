		Hi!
		</p>

		</p>
		I'm <b>Scott Rosoff</b>.
		</p>
		
		</p>
		I'm currently a data scientist at Microsoft. 
		I studied Electrical Engineering at UW where I spent lots of my time learning audio processing (think Auto-Tune). 
		Additional audio topics like speech recognition have always fascinated me, which naturally led to a wonderful path of learning Machine Learning.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		At Microsoft, I'm able to apply a lot of these learned ML techniques (and learn many more!) to help improve Windows and Azure quality.
