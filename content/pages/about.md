Hi! 

I'm <b>Scott Rosoff</b>.

I'm currently a data scientist at Microsoft. I studied Electrical Engineering at UW where I spent lots of my time learning audio processing (think Auto-Tune). Additional audio topics like speech recognition have always fascinated me, which naturally led to a wonderful path of learning Machine Learning.

At Microsoft, I'm able to apply a lot of these learned ML techniques (and learn many more!) to help improve Windows and Azure quality.
