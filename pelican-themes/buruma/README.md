# Buruma

Buruma is a [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) theme built with the CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io).

The current version is the 0.1.0. Before this one Buruma was in [0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/ivanhercaz/buruma/releases/tag/0.1.0-alpha), not recommended for production. 

If you want to use Buruma, I recommend you to read the available [quickstart](https://buruma.ivanhercaz.com/quickstart) in the documentation website, because it might help you to decide if Buruma is fine for you at this moment.

## Documentation

It is available in the [documentation website](https://buruma.ivanhercaz.com). If you want to test Buruma, you may be interested in the [quickstart](https://buruma.ivanhercaz.com/quickstart). There is a page dedicated to Buruma [settings](https://buruma.ivanhercaz.com/settings.html).
